# E-Library Management System (Database Management Project)

## üìò Project Overview

This project is a **Database Management System (DBMS)** developed as part of our **Diploma in Information & Communication Technology (Semester 2)** coursework. The focus of the project is on designing a comprehensive **E-Library Management System** that simulates real-world library management processes including borrowing, returning, reserving books, and tracking book details, members, and loan rules.

The project highlights our understanding and practical application of core database concepts such as:

- Business Rules Definition  
- Data Normalization (UNF, 1NF, 2NF, 3NF)  
- Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) Design  
- Schema Design and Implementation  
- DBMS vs File-Based System Analysis

## üìö Project Description

The system was designed for a **modern library in Kuala Lumpur**, addressing the challenges of the traditional file-based system and demonstrating the efficiency and reliability of using DBMS. It models real-life scenarios, rules, and constraints based on extensive business rule definitions and normalization procedures to reduce redundancy and maintain data integrity.

## About the Project

This system:

- Demonstrates the disadvantages of a traditional file-based system  
- Highlights the benefits of DBMS in library data handling  
- Establishes clear **business rules** for borrowing and managing books  
- Applies **normalization techniques** (UNF ‚Üí 1NF ‚Üí 2NF ‚Üí 3NF)  
- Features a comprehensive **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**  
- Ensures **data integrity**, **minimized redundancy**, and **efficient retrieval**

## üìÑ Note

This is an academic project submitted as part of our coursework. Please refer to the full assignment document for in-depth explanations, diagrams, and normalization processes.
